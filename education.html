        <h1>Importance of Self-Defense Training</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="eduDescription">
        <div class="infoContainer">

            <div class="infoEle">
                <h3>1. Protection:</h3>
                <p>A fundamental purpose of self-defense training is to provide protection against crime or abuse. As
                    discussed earlier, children are vulnerable to crime, so it is crucial to enable them to protect
                    themselves in difficult situations. Children often do not know how to react when they are subjected
                    to violence. Some people may suggest carrying weapons, but attackers can overpower children and use
                    those weapons against them. Self-defense training, such as karate and judo, can teach students to
                    use their bodies as weapons. It not only teaches them how to defend themselves from an attacker but
                    also builds an understanding of when and where to use the skills they are learning.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="infoEle">
                <h3>2. Boosting social skills:</h3>
                <p>Self-defense training focuses on fostering respect for oneself and others. Once students receive
                    self-defense training, they also feel more responsible for protecting those around them, especially
                    if they witness someone in trouble. It is a societal stereotype that training in martial arts
                    promotes violence, but it is much more than just kicking and punching. Self-defense techniques like
                    martial arts help students develop social skills, teamwork skills, and leadership skills, as well as
                    build healthy relationships with their peers. Students also learn to respect and follow their
                    instructors, and this respect is reflected in the classroom through their adherence to rules and
                    instructions from educators.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="infoEle">
                <h3>3. Empowering girls:</h3>
                <p>Instances of harassment against girls are increasing day by day. Many incidents go unreported, which
                    further contributes to the rise in crime. Running self-defense programs in schools is essential to
                    empower girls against harassment. Self-defense training develops a sense of fearlessness and
                    cultivates mental and physical strength among girls. Abuse of girl children is a major reason for
                    low attendance and dropout rates among girls in schools. Such training also plays an important role
                    in spreading awareness about the significance of empowering girls within the community.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="infoEle">
                <h3>4. Boosting self-confidence:</h3>
                <p>Self-defense classes, regardless of gender and age, help build confidence among students. These
                    classes begin with mindfulness and encourage students to face challenges and step out of their
                    comfort zones. Self-defense training not only conditions the body to be more fit but also helps
                    overcome feelings of self-doubt and fear, ultimately igniting confidence in students.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="infoEle">
                <h3>5. Improving Physical and Mental Health:</h3>
                <p>Self-defense programs themselves serve as a great way to exercise. The busy schedules of students
                    often make it difficult for them to find time for physical activity. Self-defense training
                    contributes to achieving body tone and fitness through proper training. Exercise releases
                    endorphins, which reduce stress, improve mood, and enhance overall well-being. For those who have
                    experienced a crime, self-defense can also act as a healing process, allowing students to regain
                    control over their lives and overcome trauma. Furthermore, self-defense helps strengthen the
                    mind-body connection.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="infoEle">
                <h3>6. Learning values and principles:</h3>
                <p>Various self-defense training programs cultivate values and principles such as hard work, dedication,
                    and perseverance. Martial arts and other self-defense techniques teach students values like courage,
                    discipline, integrity, humility, and honor. Self-defense also teaches students to overcome
                    challenges and tap into their inner capabilities. It is crucial for students to develop a positive
                    perspective toward failure, and self-defense techniques instill this mindset by encouraging students
                    to embrace failure as an opportunity for growth and learning.</p>
